#Portfolio Website
##Introduction

Hello there! This is my portfolio website developed for one of my university courseworks. It is also my first ever website made and published! Hope you'll find it decent enough, and please give suggestions to the designs and sorts.

Here is the link to the website: [takukou.github.io](https://takukou.github.io)
